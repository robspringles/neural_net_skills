in contrast with sequence mining association rule learn typically do not consider the order of item either within a transaction or across transaction
in database schema asynchronous i o or non sequential i o be a form of input output processing that permit other processing to continue before the transmission have finish
input and output
i o operation on a computer can be extremely slow compare to the processing of datum
an i o device can incorporate mechanical device that must physically move such as a hard drive seek a track to read or write this be often order of magnitude slower than the switching of electric current
for example during a disk operation that take ten millisecond to perform a processor that be clock at one gigahertz could have perform ten million instruction processing cycle
a simple approach to i o would be to start the access and then wait for -PRON- to complete
but such an approach call synchronous blocking i o would block the progress of a program while the communication be in progress leave system resource idle
when a program make many i o operation such as a program mainly or largely dependent on user input this mean that the processor can spend almost all of -PRON- time idle wait for i o operation to complete
alternatively -PRON- be possible to start the communication and then perform processing that do not require that the i o be complete

in computing a hash table hash map be a data structure which implement an associative array abstract datum type a structure that can map key to value
a hash table use a hash function to compute an index into an array of bucket or slot from which the desire value can be find
ideally the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket but most hash table design employ an imperfect hash function which may because hash collision where the hash function generate the same index for more than one key
such collision must be accommodate in some way
in a well dimensioned hash table the average cost number of instruction for each lookup be independent of the number of element store in the table
many hash table design also allow arbitrary insertion and deletion of key value pair at amortize constant average cost per operation
in many situation hash table turn out to be on average more efficient than search tree or any other table lookup structure
for this reason -PRON- be widely use in many kind of computer software particularly for associative array database indexing cache and set
