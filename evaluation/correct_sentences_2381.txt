in computing a hash table hash map be a data structure which implement an associative array abstract datum type a structure that can map key to value
a hash table use a hash function to compute an index into an array of bucket or slot from which the desire value can be find
ideally the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket but most hash table design employ an imperfect hash function which may because hash collision where the hash function generate the same index for more than one key
such collision must be accommodate in some way
in a well dimensioned hash table the average cost number of instruction for each lookup be independent of the number of element store in the table
many hash table design also allow arbitrary insertion and deletion of key value pair at amortize constant average cost per operation
